## The Bechdel Test

This Lede Project is about the Bechdel Test. 

It's a simple rule to assess the representation of women in movies. 

I'm going to use the following API:
https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc

and also data from IMDB (https://datasets.imdbws.com/). 
- name.basics.tsv.gz and title.ratings.tsv.gz


I found a few different ways of analyzing movies and using different APIs online, like:
- DataForGoodFR, BechdelAi (https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/bechdelai/blob/main/tutorials/1.%20Fetching%20data%20from%20Bechdeltest.com.ipynb)
- Maria Mouschoutzi,
(https://datacream.substack.com/p/a-bechdel-test-analysis-of-science)

I am going to try to follow Maria Mouschoutzi's approach and code to get the data. 
All the credit goes to her!
My goal is to analyze different aspects though - escpecially the romantic genre.
